PROBLEM STATEMENT

The assignment has many sub parts

a) Implement nanogpt from scratch using your own code in pytorch, tensorflow and jax (3 colabs please). Take help from code interpreter gpt4 plugin. The code should be modular in colab and should have same caliber of debugging as the original colab

You need to demonstrate the code as well as write a medium article explaining sections of code in depth

You need to use this to train a model for a book - pick differnet from shakespear book that is used in nanogpt

All artifacts need to be provided including colab, medium article, input, output, short presentation explaining the code (10 minutes) step by step

b) Implement "textbooks are all you need" case study with your own data

full colab and all artifacts

use colab pro a100 setup

use smaller amount of data
